<h2>The Team</h3>
<p><?= Yii::app()->name ?> was envisioned by Professor Neocles Leontis of Bowling Green State University for use in his biochemistry class. Having created a simple card game that allowed students to view metabolism as a whole, he partnered with Dominic Zirbel to develop an online version to allow for interactability and useability.</p>
